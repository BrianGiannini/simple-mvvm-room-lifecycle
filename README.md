# ArchitectureExampleCondingInFlow
Little notes app that demonstrate some elements from Architecture Components, mainly Room database and viewModel

It also contains an interesting example of ListAdapter for recyclerView, which will allow us to have nice animations automatically. 

I developed this project following this great course from Coding in Flow (though I converted it to Kotlin):
